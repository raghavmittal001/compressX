Universal File Compressor (Huffman-Based)

This project provides a universal file compression and decompression system built using Huffman Coding in C. It supports all file types, including text, images, audio, video, PDFs, documents, and binary files. The tool ensures that after decompression, the file is restored to its original extension and format without any loss.

This repository also includes a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend to upload and download compressed/decompressed files.
